// Exercise: scope (unexported, exported)
// Use prints when necessary
/*
    1. In this file, import the animals package using (import pack1/animals).
    Create an object of type Lion. Try printing the object. See if this compiles.
    If no, try to understand why ? What changes will you make to
    compile it successful?

    2. Create an object of type Cat from the animals package.
    The main program canâ€™t compile because we are trying to
    access the unexported type animal from inside the composite
    literal. How can you make this compilable and print the object.

    Hint: Creating an object of type Cat can be a bit tricky because
    of struct within struct
